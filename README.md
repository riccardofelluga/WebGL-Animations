# WebGL-Animations

This is the repository for the course project of WWW Application _CS-E4460_ @Aalto university. It implements a POC to render animations in the browser with [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/)

## Quick start

Getting up and running is very easy, thanks to [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) you'll need to run just these two commands in sequence: `npm install` and `npm start`. 

🛠 Quick troubleshooting tip: Parcel can be started with caching disabled by running `npm run no-cache`.
